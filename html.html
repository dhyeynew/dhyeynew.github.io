        <p> <h3>Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.
         Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself
         and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</h3>

        <p> <h3>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
           I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the
            sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to 
            smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
            experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn,
            and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.</h3>
